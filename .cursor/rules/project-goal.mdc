The goal of this project is to create a job search "engine" that only looks at the career pages of companies, and not at other job search engines. The technology used is https://mastra.ai/, which is a TypeScript AI workflow and agent builder.

In its final stage, the project will have the following features:
1. Given a company page or a job ad, it finds the company's career page.
2. Given a list of career pages, it finds relevant jobs. That means traversing through the pages.
3. Given a person's CV, LinkedIn, etc., it generates a "search profile" for the AI.
4. Updates/re-runs searches on career pages.
